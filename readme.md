# Explana - Explorative Analytics

The purpose of this project is to do explorative analytics on a variety of subjects where good data
is freely available online. All analysis and visualization will be viewable through the deployment
of a streamlit app and the code for running the analysis will if everything goes according to plan
be open so anyone can rerun it.
